# PA Media Group - QA Engineer Technical Assessment

## Part 1: QA Challenge

What are we looking for?

  - A programmatical test suite utilising a language and framework of your choice.
  - A test suite published into a publicly accessible Git-based repository (e.g. GitHub) with a README containing an overview of your test suite, and clear "execution instructions".


Feature to test:

 - As a MetaWeather API client, I want to retrieve “tomorrows” weather for “Nottingham”
Acceptance:
 - Ensure you consider the full anatomy of a RESTful API’s endpoint. See [this article at smashingmagazine.com for tips.](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/01/understanding-using-rest-api/)

Things to think about:
  - How can I expand the test to include different locations?
  - How can I expand the test to include other dates?

Stretch Feature:

  - A Customer has reported that they have already found a bug within the API but are unwilling to share the details. Build a feature test to expose the issue.

### API details:

Documentation and API url are available here: [https://www.metaweather.com/api](https://www.metaweather.com/api)

### Assessment:

We will be assessing how you approach this challenge. We will be look at the how, why & what you have thought about testing as well as the technical implementation.

## Part 2: Questions
            
  - Explain why you chose to use those particular tools/frameworks in the technical assessment?
  - Describe the reason for the scope of your solution. Why did you test what you did, and why didn’t you test others?
  - What questions would you ask your Product Owner / what information would you need to know, to be able to test the whole MetaWeather API service?
  - After completing the technical challenge, what would you do differently if you were asked to do the same challenge again?
